  <!-- SECTION 1 (Renamed to "Racism") -->
  <h2>1. Racism</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong> In this short clip, Ben brags about his newly acquired EBT card and condescends 
    to minority groups using various racial epithets and ethnic slur variants, such as 
    “Spic*, Ni***maxxing, negroid, spic*ville, and burka lady.”

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <h2>2. Domestic Abuse & Cyberbullying of Females</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong> The first file is a recording of a phone conversation with Ben, in which he speaks 
    at length about strangling his past girlfriend Lada Fillippov of Ashland, MA (whom he used to cohabitate with 
    at UMASS Amherst) and enjoying it. The second file is an excerpt from Ben's neuropsych evaluation, specifically 
    page 4, paragraph 3, where his mother recounts how he “traumatized” a girl at school with cyberbullying. 
    File 3 is the entire neuropsych to confirm the validity of this extracted excerpt if desired. 
    Ben is presently, as of January, 2025, facing potential criminal charges for harassing Middle Eastern female 
    students from UMASS Amherst on social media after receiving a court order to cease contact with them during 
    the spring 2024 semester due to another incident where he was arraigned for harassing them. 
    Ben also threatened the Beshara family of New Hampshire with violence and financial harm stating he intends 
    to “k***” them in November 2024.

  <!-- SECTION 3 -->
  <h2>3. Criminal Activity: Selling Juul Pods & Vapes to Underage Minors & Without a Business License</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong> The files in this section are a recording dated April 2020, where Ben describes 
    in depth his illegal enterprise, selling Juul pods and vapes he buys on the internet to his friends and 
    acquaintances for resale to other underage people at the time of the recording when he was 18, and numerous 
    EML files for receipts containing active tracking links for his many wholesale or bulk quantity purchases 
    of Vapes and Juul pods, pursued for redistribution among school children. The recording contains a full 
    admission of guilt for reselling vapes and Juul pods from the internet to minors, and without a business 
    license while the EML files and their respective active tracking links illustrate a trend of growth in 
    principal, reflecting the scale and impact of his past illicit business and its potential harm on minors 
    and the public; nevermind, how it harmed legitimate businesses by syphoning potential customers due to lack 
    of compliance with the law.
