  <!-- SECTION 1 (Renamed to "Racism") -->
  <h2>1. Racism</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 800px; word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.6;">In this short clip which Ben recorded and freely disseminated, he brags about his newly acquired EBT card and condescends to minority groups using various racial epithets and ethnic slur variants, such as "Spic*, Ni***maxxing, negroid, spic*ville, and burka lady."</p>

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <h2>2. Domestic Abuse &amp; Cyberbullying of Females</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 800px; word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.6;">Section 2 description replacement:
The first file was intended to be a recording of a phone conversation with Ben, in which he speaks 
at length about strangling his past girlfriend Lada Fillippov of Ashland, MA (whom he used to cohabitate with 
at UMASS Amherst) and enjoying it. However, two party consent is required in the state in which it was recorded; hence, its absence. Lada Fillippov may be contacted to confirm this: https://www.instagram.com/ladafilippov/
The second file is an excerpt from Ben's neuropsych evaluation, specifically page 4, paragraph 3, where his mother recounts how he “traumatized” a girl at school with cyberbullying. File 3 is the entire neuropsych to confirm the validity of this extracted excerpt if desired. Ben is presently, as of January, 2025, facing potential criminal charges for harassing Middle Eastern female students from UMASS Amherst on social media after receiving a court order to cease contact with them during 
the spring 2024 semester due to another incident where he was arraigned for harassing them. Ben also threatened the Beshara family of New Hampshire with violence and financial harm stating he intends to “k***” them in November 2024. Ellen Beshara may be contacted to confirm this: https://www.instagram.com/e_besh/</p>

  <h2>3. Criminal Activity: Selling Juul Pods &amp; Vapes to Underage Minors &amp; Without a Business License</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 800px; word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.6;">
Section 3 description replacement:
The file in this section is a recording dated April 2020, where Ben while fully aware he was being recorded describes in depth his illegal enterprise, selling Juul pods and vapes he buys on the internet to his friends and acquaintances for resale to other underage people at the time of the recording when he was 18. The recording contains a full admission of guilt for reselling vapes and Juul pods from the internet to minors, and without a business license.
